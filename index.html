            Enjoy Your Food is a healthy organic lifestyle promotion channel. We create tutorials and recipes on creating healthy
            delicious food for our audience. We try a variety of different recipes ranging from coconut melon smoothies(Cocomelon),
            watermelon sugar smoothies, pumpkin scones, and sautéed spinach. We allow for everyone to be as 
            healthy(Ranging from physical health to clear skin) as any celebrity they see on the internet like Pewdiepie and Markiplier.
            Each one of our videos has music that resembles lofi or study music. It is undisputed that our recipes come from a wide
            variety of sources like China, the United States, or Ukraine. We make sure that the quality of our food is not slime
            and is appetizing enough for you to share it with your family. We get this quality because we are a believer in the food
            we publish and make sure that we don't fall short of your expectations. Quite the opposite we hope to take your expectations
            of us to the moon. Among us, on our team we have dedicated people that will work hard to make sure that you get the best content from us.

                Pumpkin Puree was the very first food tutorial we ever posted.<br>
                After buying pumpkins, we decided to see what we could make with the left over pumpkin.<br>
                This led to the creation of our pumpkin puree and pumpkin scones.
